# **Password Generator**

## **Overview:**

This is the Day 5 project from the 100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp. The Password Generator creates strong passwords by combining lowercase letters, uppercase letters, numbers, and symbols. By default, it generates an 8-character password, but users can specify a custom length of at least 8 characters.


## **How It Works:**

The password generator creates a password by combining lowercase letters, uppercase letters, numbers, and symbols. 

1. **Initial Password Generation**: By default, the program generates an 8-character password.
2. **User Prompt**: After displaying the initial password, the user is asked if they want to generate another password.
3. **Custom Length**: If the user opts for another password, they are prompted to enter the desired length (minimum 8 characters).

## **Features:**

- Generates a password that includes at least one lowercase letter, one uppercase letter, one number, and one symbol.
- Shuffles the characters to ensure randomness.
- Allows users to specify the length of the password for custom requirements.
